Email notifications are sent from resnet.data.portal@gmail.com. Remember to check your spam folder! Figure 2.3: Account pending approval Once you’ve signed up, a notification will be sent to the Data Portal Administrators to activate your new account. This may take some time (normal working hours). Figure 2.4: Account activated After your account has been activated, you will receive an email notification. At the time of writing, this email notification includes an invalid link. You can still navigate to https://data.nsercresnet.ca and login as normal. Figure 2.5: Sign in location Figure 2.6: Sign in prompt You can now sign in to the Data Portal using the credentials you’ve created. 2.2 Managing your profile From your user profile you can: Customize your appearance (set a display name, add an avatar image) Manage your Data Portal preferences (notifications) View your activity and content (recent uploads, Layers) See the GeoNode documentation for more information about your user profile. Figure 2.7: Navigate to profile Figure 2.8: View profile Figure 2.9: Edit profile 2.3 Joining a group Groups have been created for each ResNet Landscape and Theme. Additional groups may be created for specific projects or for the special handling of sensitive data. Layers assigned to a group are visible to all group members. Group Managers moderate activity within a Group and review associated content. A Group Manager must Approve a layer for publication before it is visible to users outside of the Group. Layers can be assigned to a Group through the Metadata Wizard. See Basic Metadata: Group. Figure 2.10: Navigate to groups Navigate to About &gt; Groups.

"],["data-layers.html", "Chapter 3 Data Layers 3.1 Preparing data 3.2 Uploading a new layer 3.3 Managing layers 3.4 Publishing layers", " Chapter 3 Data Layers 3.1 Preparing data Preparing your data for submission is critical. It’s much easier to get your data into a clear, workable, standardized format on your local machine, rather than attempting to modify it after submission to the Data Portal. Emphasis is placed on geospatial data, but many other types of data can be submitted to the Data Portal as well. See Other Data Types. Data preparation (and management) are extensive topics. We’ll lay out the basics and some quick tips here, and cover these aspects in greater depth in the future. 3.1.1 General 3.1.1.1 Filenaming Using clear, descriptive, and compatible filenames for your data is an important aspect of data management. Inappropriate filenames are not only confusing, they may also cause issues within the Data Portal that render the layer unusable. Follow the best practices below for best results. Descriptive: A succinct, descriptive filename is important for identifying and managing datasets. Length: Excessively long filenames can trigger unexpected behavior. Try to limit your filenames to about 20 characters. Characters: A filename with non-standard characters can trigger errors. Stick with these guidelines. Use basic Latin alphanumerics (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) Do not include characters with diacritics/accent marks (ñ) The data itself can contain non-basic Latin characters, but it’s still important to be aware of character encoding. This blog will tell you more than you wanted to (but should) know. Use dashes (-) or underscores (_) to separate terms Only use periods (.) before the file extension Avoid including spaces/blank spaces () Unique: If a filename matches that of an existing layer, the Data Portal automatically appends random characters to the filename. Include a version number in your filename if you’d like to avoid this. 3.1.1.2 Size limitations Data files larger than 1gb will fail to upload to the Data Portal, and files approaching that limit may experience issues. Large, national-scale datasets (eg. landcover) may be available on public map servers hosted by external organization. Using these existing resources is a good way to bring large datasets into the Data Portal to combine with internal layers, without worrying about size limitations. See Adding Remote Services. If you’ve created a large research dataset that needs to be added to the Data Portal, coordinate with the Data Manager. 3.1.2 Projection For an introduction and overview of spatial coordinate systems and projects, see this ESRI article EPSG Codes are a succinct, standardized method for referencing common geospatial projections. Typically, the Data Portal will accept spatial data in any projection with a properly declared EPSG code. In practice, projection systems can be complex. Initially you may want to stick with one of the most common projections until you are more familiar with the Data Portal. WGS84 (EPSG:4326). Basic longitude and latitude coordinates. Units are in decimal degrees. Web Mercator (EPSG:4326). Commonly used to render data for web maps. Units are in meters. We’ll cover projection fundamentals and best practices for transforming projections in a future workshop. 3.1.3 Vector The most common format for storing vector data is the Shapefile. 3.1.4 Raster The recommended format for storing and submitting raster data is GeoTIFF. 3.1.5 Other Non-geospatial datasets can be submitted to the Data Portal as Documents. File formats for Document objects include text files (.doc, .docx, .txt, .odt), spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx, .ods), presentations (.ppt, .pptx, .odp), images (.gif, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff), PDF, zip files (.rar, .zip, .gz), SLD, XML or QML files. Descriptive metadata is critical for the discovery and reusability of Document datasets, as the user will not be able to view the contents of a Document before downloading the file. See Documents in the GeoNode documentation for more information about uploading, managing, and creating metadata for Documents. 3.1.5.1 Tabular We’ll cover best practices for formatting and managing tabular data in a future workshop. 3.2 Uploading a new layer Figure 3.1: Upload layer from site menu Navigate to Data &gt; Upload Layer from the top menu. Figure 3.2: Select files to upload Click Choose files and navigate to the dataset on your local computer. Select the data files to be uploaded. If a dataset is composed of multiple files, be sure to select all associated files. For example, ESRI shapefiles, a common format for vector data, actually consist of four+ separate files) Figure 3.3: Verify selection and upload Confirm the result looks as intended. Click the Upload files button. Figure 3.4: Upload in progress Monitor progress within Upload status. If an error occurs: Verify that you are able to display the data on your local computer Recheck your file selection Retry uploading the files Get help Figure 3.5: Upload completed successfully Figure 3.6: Layer info If the upload completes successfully: Initially, the layer will only be visible to you. You’ll need to assign the layer to a Group before it can be viewed by any other registered users, and complete the Data Publication process before the data is publically available. See Publishing Layers. Proceed to Managing Layers to customize the description and symbology of your layer. 3.2.1 Adding remote services The Data Portal can integrate layers from external map servers, such as Geoserver Web Map Services (WMS) and ArcGIS REST MapServers. See Using Remote Services in the GeoNode documentation for details. 3.3 Managing layers See the GeoNode documentation for Layer Info and Layer Tools 3.3.1 Remove layer A layer can be removed through the Editing Tools. Navigate to a layer page, click Editing Tools to open menu, click Remove, and confirm. This action can only be performed by the Owner of the layer or a Data Portal Administrator. Figure 3.7: Layer editing tools Figure 3.8: Remove layer 3.3.2 Styling layer Figure 3.9: Viewing a layer Layer styles control the appearance and visualization of data layers. A layer can have multiple styles associated with it. The Data Portal includes an interactive tool for creating geospatial styles. See Layer Styling in the GeoNode documentation for detailed instructions. We’ll cover this in greater depth in a future workshop. 3.4 Publishing layers Upload a layer -&gt; Layer pending approval Author Metadata Assign to group -&gt; Layer visible to group Request Group Manager review After Manager approval -&gt; Visible to public This protocol is still in development. Please bear with us. Full details coming soon. 3.4.1 Publication Workflow Figure 3.10: Data publication workflow "],["maps.html", "Chapter 4 Maps 4.1 Creating maps 4.2 Embedding maps", " Chapter 4 Maps We’ll cover this in greater depth in a future workshop. 4.1 Creating maps Multiple layers can be combined and visualized within the Data Portal by creating maps. See Managing Maps in the GeoNode documentation for more information. 4.2 Embedding maps Maps created using the Data Portal can be shared externally, or embedded directly within other webpages. However, note that the visibility of a map is still dependent on the layers it contains. If layers are unpublished they will not be displayed. See Publishing layers. "],["metadata.html", "Chapter 5 Metadata 5.1 Wizard", " Chapter 5 Metadata Metadata is a critical component. A dataset must be associated with valid and comprehensive metadata. Metadata is also a complex and evolving process. Partial metadata is always better than no metadata. Do your best to provide relevant information and stay tuned for further refinement in our metadata workflows. The Data Portal provides several methods for managing metadata. This guide will focus on the Metadata Wizard. See the GeoNode documentation for the Advanced Editing and Uploading of metadata. 5.1 Wizard Figure 5.1: Accessing the metadata wizard The Metadata Wizard guides the user through a series of forms intended to reflect the core required fields of the ISO Standard, and therefore generate fully compliant records for the layer. In practice, the fields and descriptions can be confusing. Descriptions of each field are provided here for clarification. Unfortunately, these definitions are currently incomplete. This page will be updated in the very near future. 5.1.1 Page 1: Basic Metadata Thumbnail Preview image of the layer. See layer management Title A clear and understandable title for the layer. This will be displayed in the Data Portal layer listings and the legend of any maps incorporating the layer. Abstract Brief description of the layer content. Date type Whether the date is associated with the Creation, Publication, or Revision of a layer Date Date of the event above Category Select a top-level category to describe the layer. Options are defined by the ISO metadata standard. The available choices may not be a perfect fit for your research. We can consider adding additional categories or adopting a network specific schema in the future. In the meantime, please select the closest match. Group Optionally, select a Group to associate the layer with. Note: By assigning a layer to a group, that layer will be made visible to all members of the group. Be cautious when managing layers containing sensitive data. You do not need to assign a group to manage and view a layer you have uploaded. See Joining a group. Free-text Keywords A free form space to associate descriptive keywords with your data. Multiple keywords can be added by separating them with a comma (eg. Watersheds, Hydrology, Nitrogen Cycle). In the future, the Network may adapt a standard schema based on our shared framework. For now, use your best judgement to assign terms that will help users discover data relevant to their interests. 5.1.2 Page 2: Location and Licenses Language Language used within the dataset. Note that some restrictions apply to filenaming, but not to the characters contained in the data itself. However, users should be aware that character encoding is an important consideration in data management. This blog will tell you more than you wanted to (but should) know. License If you have not identified a license for your dataset, select “Not Specified”. If the relevant license is not reflected by the options available, contact the Data Administrator. Licensing will need to be clarified before a layer can be published (visible to others). Attribution Still working on this translation Regions Currently Canada is the smallest scale available. Sub units may be added in the future. Use Canada for now. Data quality statements x Restrictions Another grey area. To be clarified. Other constraints Please use this space to convey any prior licensing, data sensitivity, or additional considerations applicable to your data. 5.1.3 Page 3: Optional Metadata Edition x DOI Link to a persistent Digital Object Identifier, if available. The network may look into providing DOIs in the future.

Two channels relevant to the Data Portal are: @data-portal-users - Discussions specific to using the Data Portal. Features, issues, shared content @data - General questions about data. Best practices for processing and managing, analysis methods, sharing external data sources 7.3 Data Office Hours An informal time to drop in and chat about all things data: discovery, processing, analysis, visualization, development, publication… Brainstorm methods and troubleshoot workflows. Typically on Wednesdays from 2-3pm ET over Slack. Contact John if you’d like to set something up then or any other time. 7.4 Request Support When requesting support, it’s important to provide a detailed description of the problem you’re facing and specific information about your situation. Below are some guidelines for writing an effective support ticket. Always include: Subject: A succinct description of the task you’re attempting and the issue encountered. Poor: “Can’t see file” Good: “Data Portal - Unable to view layer after upload” Objective: What are you trying to do? Issue: What obstacles or errors have you encountered? Troubleshoot: Have you tried any other methods?
