## Slack

The ResNet Slack is a great place for asking questions, sharing issues and solutions, and collaborating asynchronously.

Two channels relevant to the Data Portal are:

-   `@data-portal-users` - Discussions specific to using the Data Portal. Features, issues, shared content
-   `@data` - General questions about data. Best practices for processing and managing, analysis methods, sharing external data sources

## Data Office Hours

An informal time to drop in and chat about all things data: discovery, processing, analysis, visualization, development, publication... Brainstorm methods and troubleshoot workflows.

Typically on Wednesdays from 2-3pm ET over Slack. Contact John if you'd like to set something up then or any other time.

## Request Support

-   Supporting info: Screenshots, error codes etc.

If related to a dataset/layer, also include:

-   Format

### Example

    from: test.user@email.com
    to: resnet.data.portal@gmail.com 
    subject: Data Portal - Unable to view layer after upload

    Hello,

    I uploaded a new layer to the Data Portal. The status page said the upload 
    completed, but now I'm unable to view it. This happened around 2pm EST on 
    2021-12-14. I retried uploading the layer but am still unable to view it.
